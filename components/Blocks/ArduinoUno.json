If this is your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust board you can start playing with.<br>The UNO is the most used and documented board of the whole Arduino &amp; Genuino family. Arduino/Genuino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet).<br>It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.<br>It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.<br>You can tinker with your UNO without worring too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno\">More Info</a>.</p>\n<p>This text is provided under the <strong>Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0</strong></p>\n",
